- A link to GIT branching tutorials: https://learngitbranching.js.org/
        This application allows you to see the functionality of branching in GIT, in a much clearer and obvious manner. 
        In this tutorial I have completed the first 4 steps. These 4 steps welcome control over branching, using git branch, git commit, git checkout, git merge and git rebase.
            -git commit: allows a file to be saved, updating your repository and saving a backup of your   
             original repository. 
            -git checkout: allows the user to switch between branches. 
            -git merge: allows the user to merge branches together. 
            -git rebase: allows the user to tidy the code and make the branching more linear, 
             yet continues to hold an identity for that branch. 
             
COMMENTS
  - Keep comments clean and clear and concise in explaining what functions do ETC. 
  - Let functions and the such explain themselves ie; 
                                                        if(wage > 50000 && hasChild = true) 
                                                         [
                                                             isAbleToRecieveChildBenefit
                                                         ]
  - Keep comments simple and informative. 
  - Sometimes clarification in comments is neccesary. 
  - Some comments may be used to warn the user of changes that may occur based on functions ETC. 
  - To-Do comments, these are important to use to keep track of where you're currently changing code. 
  - Keep legal comments, Copyright ETC. As to protect your work.
