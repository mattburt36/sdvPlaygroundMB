- A link to GIT branching tutorials: https://learngitbranching.js.org/
        This application allows you to see the functionality of branching in GIT, in a much clearer and obvious manner. 
        In this tutorial I have completed the first 4 steps. These 4 steps welcome control over branching, using git branch, git commit, git checkout, git merge and git rebase.
            -git commit: allows a file to be saved, updating your repository and saving a backup of your   
             original repository. 
            -git checkout: allows the user to switch between branches. 
            -git merge: allows the user to merge branches together. 
            -git rebase: allows the user to tidy the code and make the branching more linear, 
             yet continues to hold an identity for that branch.
